üåê **[Live Demo](https://toxsam.github.io/NFT-File-Manager/)** | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ToxSam/NFT-File-Manager)

## What's in a Name?

The name "Cista" draws inspiration from ancient history - originally a cylindrical vessel used to safeguard precious items. In Roman times, a cista was a sacred container that evolved from a simple basket into an elegant repository for valuable possessions. Much like its historical namesake, our Cista serves as a digital vessel for your valuable 3D NFT assets, allowing you to access, view, and interact with them in a secure and elegant way.

## Why Cista?

This app was created to empower NFT collectors and creators to easily access and interact with their 3D files directly from their wallets. No more struggling with complex file formats or technical barriers - Cista makes it simple to view and manage your digital assets.
